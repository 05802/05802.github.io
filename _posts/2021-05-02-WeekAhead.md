Commodity prices conitnue to increase 
*  CRB Commodity Index +71% y/y, 6% 2y CAGR   
*  Goldman flags commodity stregnth, forecasts $80/ barrel crude due to demand exceeding supply  
*  Opec + maintains 8m barrel/ day voluntary output cut, plan to add 2.1m barrel/ day from May to June, remained unchanged  
*  Additional demand and exogenous supply constraints (weather, throughput capacity) are expected to continue to weigh on supply, leading to higher prices 

Swap market prices steeper term structure
