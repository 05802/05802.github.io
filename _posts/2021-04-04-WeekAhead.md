## SENTIMENT
US Divergence 
* Economic optimism brings forward implied policy rate increase: Dec 2022  
* March employment report delivered the high range of a notably wide estimate  
* Vaccine woes amid outbreak trigger some EU restrictions 

## DATA POINTS 

* TUE APR 06 1000  - US BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  
* WED APR 07 1400  - FOMC Meeting Minutes  
* FRI APR 09 0830 - Canada Monthly Employment Change  
Consensus: +90k m/m

## Questions 
* CBDC - a conduit for inflation, or more efficient tool than currently preferred monetary policy levers?
* Will select supply bottlenecks increase margins in 2021? Companies may prioritize higher margin deliveries? 
* Buy side seems to be pricing in more optimism vs. public consensus. Does 'earnings management' delivery 2022 upside surprise?
