*  New treasury supply was digested without significant price impact  
*  Fed's promise of maintaining 'lower rates for longer' found more credible
*  What the meaning of 'substantial further progress' is not, became more clear     

Positive earnings surprise test implied market expectations  
* SP500 companies have beat consensus estimates, without seeing price appreciation  

## DATA POINTS
